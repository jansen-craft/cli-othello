### Sourcing

Most of the code for this project is written by me with the exceptions of the **game** class and the **colors.hpp** file. This othello game was a part of a C++ course at Ohio University & along with it came said game class with the file detailing the ANSI escape codes. All credit for the colors file goes to Matthew Beldyk, and credit for the game class goes to John Dolan.
